* Pretty good comparison of performance and concurrency of Hive, Impala and GC BigQuery. I'm curious how Presto would perform here. Unfortunately missing open-sourcing the benchmark to make it repeatable by others (even without the company private queries).

# Ending note
This is just an experiment. I'm not sure if I will systematically put stuff on that list. 
And of course I just started the list today (2018-10-15) and I don't even think about putting here what I already read in my life :)
